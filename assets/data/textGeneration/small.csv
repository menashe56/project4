"There are alot reasons to keep our the despised method of choosing the President. The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is ""Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.

Another reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that ""It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.""

Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.""So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.

And Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example ""Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.

In Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Driving smart cars that drive by themself has it's pros and cons. People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.

First let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.

Now for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.

In my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Principal,

I believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.

Look at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.

"Dear Principal,

Community service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.

Forcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.

Teenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.

Another reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.

Therefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.

Thank you for your time,

"My argument for the development of the driverless cars is that we should have them. These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.

First of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.

Second, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.

Last, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.

The driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.

In conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Studying Venus is dangerous but there is good insight we can find in this.

First,In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says ""Earth's ""Twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". Since it has a lot in common with Earth it is good to have a litle insight on this planet. In the article it says that"" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sich as valleys, moutains, and craters"" this shows how much Earth and venus have incommon. This also gives us an opertunity to take a planetary visit to Venus in the future. Despite the dangers it could cause on someone.

Next, in the reading it says that Venus has"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxid blankets"" This is one example of how dangerous Venus is. In the article is says"" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun"" This is another example of how dangers Venus is. However going to Venus is not a bad idea beacuse life form could have been there in the past. People believe life forms could have existed beacuse of the examples like caters, moutains, and valleys. Despite Venus being the hottest planet in our solar system.

Then, on that note Venus is not the cloestet planet to the sun but has the highest tempature than all of your planet's in the solar system. However studying Venus can give us insight on what to make to prevent for somone or something burning on its surface. While we have been studying Venus all we have seen is a look from a ship orbiting above the planet, that gives us little intel on it surface. We get little intil from that beaucse "" most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere"". However if scientists seeking to conduct Venus will have to get closer to the planet.

Lastly, in the reading it says"" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" but not all people know that Venus is not a star it is a planet. However to a amateur stargazer it may just look like another star. Venus is called Earths twin beaucse of how alike they are in distance. Some scientist think this is intersting and want to look into this planet despite the dangers of it. Some scientist have looked into Venus but only have sent unmanned trips. The reasoning is the ship would only last a new hours at the most on Venus.

In Conclusion,Venus is a every intersitng plaet to look into. Despite the dangers it can cause.                ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Technology in society is constantly innovating and becoming more complex. Over time, different manufacturers have tried to create successful, driverless cars. People have mixed feelings towards this for many reasons including safety and control. However, these people are not thinking about the greater outcomes of what could happen with these innovative cars. Overall, driverless cars would be very beneficial to society and the world.

Driverless cars can open up many new windows for society. Companies like Google are already experimenting with this. Since there is not legislation completely prohibiting the use of semi-autonomous cars in California, Google has taken advantage of this by using their cars to aid them in mapping the world. They have used their driverless cars to help gain more info for Google Maps. Society will gain more information about the surrounding land. This is just one possibility with these new cars.

Along with gaining new information, driverless cars can help people multitask. This is also prevalent with Google Maps. As the car scans and takes pictures of the land around it, the person in the car is able to track down and record the appropriate data. People will be able to do more with driverless cars which is more efficient. This will benefit large companies as they will be able to do more with their time. However, for many this leads to problematic thoughts. People are in fear that these cars will have safety problems and that humans will lose control. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author discusses this possible problem thouroughly. There is common misconception that driverless cars will be completely automatic, but this is not the case. Driverless cars are more for assisting rather than they are for driving. The person in the car still needs to remain alert in cases where they might need to take over. This shows that the car does not have complete control.

Another major concern is whether or not these cars are entirely safe. In the article, the author also mentions how the in-car system itself is a safety feature. The article mentions how manufacturers hope to bring in in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Anytime the person needs to take over the car, these displays can be turned off instantly. This is something that is not availables to drivers who are texting while driving. This shows how these driverless cars may even be safer than regular, self-driven cars.

To conclude, one of the greatest reasons that society should move forward with this innovative idea is that this groundbreaking technology can be beneficial in fields outside of automobiles. If engineers can successfully create an automatic car, what else will they be able to produce? More automatic devices could be created with this technology. In this fast-paced world, emptying up time is incredibly beneficial as people will then be able to do greater things. This is something that has been proven to be true since the beginning of time. Innovations such as the printing press, for example, showed this. As technology took over the mundane task of handwriting papers, printers now had more time to complete their own duties. This lead to more efficiency as well as more time for newer innovations. This ultimately helps society as a whole, and this is why driverless cars need to become successful.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have noticed that many people, including myself, struggle to achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be. This is because people often try to fit into predetermined roles and expectations rather than embracing their unique qualities and talents.

One reason why people may not be happy with their decisions is that they may feel pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations. For example, some people may feel that they need to have a certain job or income level in order to be successful or happy. However, these expectations may not align with their personal values or passions, leading to feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction.

Additionally, the world can have a significant impact on people's ability to achieve their goals and become the person they want to be. For example, external factors such as economic conditions, political instability, and natural disasters can make it difficult for people to achieve their goals.

In my opinion, the quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail,"" is particularly relevant to this issue. Emerson encourages people to forge their own path and not be afraid to take risks and make their own way in the world. By embracing their unique qualities and talents, people can achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be.

In conclusion, people often struggle to achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be because they may feel pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations or be impacted by external factors.

"Dear Principal,

In the policy containing that students should not have a grade C average to participate in school sport programs that they enjoy or any other school related activities should be changed to having a grade B average.

If you allow them to be apart of something they enjoy and care about then they shouldn't have a grade C average. Students that do what they enjoy and care about such as sports and or school activities should care enough to make the good grades for those activities. Being in those activities and sports is a privilege. Not something that is just given to you. They should care enough to make the required grades if they really wanted to play that sport or activity. Let the student know that they should have better grades in order to play the sport. It's up to them to get that grades to play the game or be in the activity. If they want to continue playing the sport or activity then they should get the grades required such as a grade B average. By telling the students that they should have a grade B average lets them know that they need to work harder to succeed. By working hard to get what they want is a great experience for the student so it teaches them to focus on whats important and be responsible for there work and what they care about. Later in life they may not have much trouble doing what needs to be done and getting it done with ease.

The policy in my opinion should be changed to the requirements of having a B average in order to play school sports and participating in school activities.

"Studying Science and History at Generic_School offers two very different experiences, each with its own advantages. Science is a constantly evolving field, with new advances and techniques being discovered daily. The school provides expert guidance and modern equipment, making it an ideal place to explore the complex theories and technologies of the subject. In contrast, History offers an opportunity to delve into the past and investigate the origins of our civilization and culture. Through lectures and field trips, Generic_School’s expert faculty provides students with a solid foundation of knowledge in the subject while also allowing them to study and discuss unique interpretations of traditional narratives. 

Both Science and History have their advantages, but in the end it comes down to each individual student’s interests and goals. If you are passionate about understanding the complexities of our world, then studying Science is the perfect choice. If, on the other hand, you enjoy delving into the past and uncovering the stories of our ancestors, then History is the subject for you. Whichever path you choose to take, the experienced faculty and resources at Generic_School will provide the guidance you need to succeed and make the most of your studies.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Imagine getting back home from school and sitting on your couch, bored out of your mind, and just waiting for something interesting to come your way.

I know from personal experience, that if kids don't have some sort of extracurricular activity going on they will simply sit and stare at their phone for hours on end.

If schools provide things such as sports, teams, and clubs then it will prevent kids from staring at their phones all day long. I think schools should require some sort of after school activity because it will get them out of their comfort zone, it can be something to look forward to, and it exposes kids the same age with similar interest to eachother.

First, extracurricular activities can help kids get out of their comfort zones. If kids are required to do something then they don't have an excuse not to join a club or sports team. Some students don't do a sport or club because they fear they won't be good enough or may be a burden to the team. However, if they go out and try their hardest they may find that they are a very valued teammate. Some students are shy and more to themselves, but being apart of a group that brings out the best in you is an amazing experience that everyone should experience.

Secondly, kids can look forward to doing something fun instead of going home and doing nothing. For example, when I first moved to Virginia I had absolutely nothing to do because I didn't have many friends. I was very sad and misserable until spring soccer tryouts. Until I started geting new friends, all I looked forward to was soccer practices and soccer games. Soccer really let me release all my stress, forget about everything, and really focus on the game.

Lastly, sports and clubs allow kids the same age to interact. Kids who are more shy can be exposed to kids who share similar interest. Sports especially require team work, which provides a strong bonding experience. I have made so many friends just by being apart of a team and getting close enough to where it is almost a family. Clubs can have the same affect on people.

In conclusion, sports and clubs are an amazing outlet to getting out of your comfort zone, looking forward to doing something, and making new amazing friends. In addition, most students are already involved in an extracurricular activity. It wouldn't really impact the amount of students getting involved in sports or clubs. I think that if schools were to require students to be involved in extracurricular activities it would have a positive outcome.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Over the summer, very few students have the desire to do any homework, especially not a project. In the scenario where a school mandates a summer project, the summer project should be student-designed. Having student-designed projects would make the assignment easier for students to complete and it would also ensure that the students are gaining knowledge from completing the assignment. Assigning a project that isn't grueling and time consuming, as teacher-designed projects tend to be, would result in more students completing the assignment and learning.

Many students never complete projects during the regular school year, and assigning a summer project would seem like an impossible task. However, if the project appealed to students it would be more likely that they would complete it and this could spark a butterfly effect that leads into the next year for those students. It would cause students who don't complete projects or assignments, to turn into consistent, non-procrastinating students. Learning is often made into a very monotonous and dreadful thing but if schools designed learning for students, intelligence would be more spread out across the school. There wouldn't be the groups of ""smart kids"", the groups of ""dumb kids"", or the groups of ""average kids"" and the school, as a whole, would be more successful.

A very typical and repetitive summer project is ""summer reading"". Many schools don't assign this as a mandatory project that is expected to be completed by every student, but is often assigned as a prerequisite to enter high level English classes or to join certain clubs. When the school year begins, a lot of very educated and worthy students are denied the ability to attend that high level class because they haven't completed the summer reading project. Now the logic behind this is, ""If a student can't read one book over the summer, how can they be expected to read multiple books throughout the entire English course ?"". What many people don't take into account, is the fact that regardless of a teenager's intelligence, they will usually neglect all school work until the last minute and end up forgetting. They will either end up not being able to fully put their knowledge to use, or lying about reading in order to enter a class, neither of these outcomes benefit the student.

An argument against these claims would be, ""If teacher-designed projects are assigned, it will be easier for teachers to grade the assignment and this could benefit the student even more by giving them a better grade and better feedback."". Teacher-designed projects are capable of this, and students would be able to receive more well-rounded, and understood grades if the assignment was being graded based off of a rubric. With a teacher-assigned project, teachers can compare each student's work to past projects that have been completed by other students and accurately determine how good the project is. These types of projects ensure that all students will learn the same amount by eliminating the option for students to do projects about something they are already very educated about in their personal life.

Student-designed projects are more reliable and consistent than teacher-designed projects. They allow students to fully display their intelligence and academic potential. They also allow students to educate themselves about a topic. This leads to better learning habits in the future; and overall, it can turn a good student into an even better student. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear State Senator,

On behalf of my right of speech to speak, I think the government shouldn't keep the Electoral College. Because it's a process, without the process of picking out who will be the next president of the United States we would be able too choose a right president, we will choose the light for the people of the United States Of America.

The presidential election is held every four years, you help choose your states electors when you vote for your President, because you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. During the election, most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that deals with all the electors to the presidential candidates. After the presidential election, The governor prepares a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates running for President in your state with name of their respective electors.

The Electoral College is a process dealing with our founding fathers, whoom which they established it in the constitution as a compomise between the elections of voting for the President in Congress or by popular vote. The Electoral College consist of 538 electors, the majority is 270. Under the 23rd Amendment of te Constitution, the District of Columbia has 3 electos and are treated lke state for a purpose of the Electoral College. In following discussion the word ""state"" also refers to the district of Columbia. Nothing is always good tho, there is always a bad side towards everything. Like in the Electoral College system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the President. The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call The disaster factor. State legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, those electors may always defy the will of the people.

They officially say that the electoral collge is unfair because the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without basis in reality. The arguments against the direct elections are spurious at best. The College is regarded as an anacrinism, a non-democratic metod of selecting a president and to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. The College restores some of the weight in the poligtical balance that large states lose by virtue of te mal-apportion of the senate decreed in the constitution. They restore some of the weight in te political balance that large states by population may lose by virtue.

The Electoral College avoids te problm of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the voting cast. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate wo nas no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they'll have less incentuve to pay attention to he campaign then rather the President being coosen by a popularity of votes.                                                                                                                              ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principle,

It is obvious that community service is an important thing in a town or city, that benefit the location in many different ways. For example, cleaning up a neighborhood makes it look more appealing, in turn makes for a healthy environment for not only children but for everybody. But, it also depends on who is doing the work for the place and why they are doing the work, some people are required because they are charged with a crime and their sentence was to serve however many hour, days, etc of community service. To me, not only is this the most honest work but this person could pose a serious threat to the community under the circumstances of what they have done. another example would be for school, if getting into a certain school requires a person to have to do a certain amount of community service, that is a very important for not only the student, but it also serves a good purpose for the community. Not to mention, a schoolboy really does not cause someone to fear for their life!

But, there are also many reasons that this boy/girl may not want to part take in community service. Yes, it is a very important necessity for people to be cleaning up their neighborhood but they should not be forced into doing it. Many of the children these days attend extra curricular activities, so depending on what time they ""must"" attend community service, it might take away from other fun things they do fore themselves. Also, if the student is having trouble in school, with or without an extra curricular, forcing them to part-take in community labor would not only hurt their grades in school, but hurting grades means hurting everyone else, even your own family. Think about it, has a mother/father even gotten a bad report about their son or daughter from a school teacher and been thrilled? No, these parents want their children to succeed in school, and succeed in life. Also, what if the child just flat out does not want to engage in a straining activity like so? Maybe they would rather spend time with their family and friends, and get to meet new people. Being socially active is important also.

Aside from many negative effects, there are benefits out of doing community service, more than one at that. For example, most of the teenage population today spends most of their time on Facebook, or the internet mostly. Making the children have to get up and volunteer in physical activities is a good thing for them, getting active and creating a healthy life style. Why spend most of your time at home, playing video games, when you can be out in the world, meeting new people and doing new things? Not to mention, community service really makes a neighborhood shine. In other words, when people are determined to make a change in their town, it not only occupies their time, but other people's time so that they could make it better looking, for all sorts or reasons. Yes, to be honest, community service is a very important thing we need right now, but don't force labor, give these kids a chance, and make it voluntary. Let our voices be heard by an authority with power. Thank you, and goodbye.

"Back in 1976 an image was captured by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In that time technology wasn't as good as it is now. So the so called Face started to spread quickly. Many people thought that this was created by aliens.

Now first of all aliens haven't been proved real yet, so if aliens aren't real then how can people say aliens did it. In the first image taken in 1976 I can understand why people are creating theories. But if you look at the one taken in 2001 you can clearly see that it is a mesa. Even in 1998, when technology was advancing, you can still see that it is a mesa or just even a type of landform.

"Dear, Principal

I know you have a hard chose at hand and here is maybe some thing to make that chose better. Out of the two policy's I think that policy number one is the one you should chose. Because you would give the students a little bit more freedom to there own lives. And also there are some time situation where students many need to talk to someone or they need to make plans to do something important. Such as one of the rare a cations such as a death of a family member or a close friend. But also it might be some thing different and happens often such as they forgot a project or assignment at home and they need some to pick it up or e-mail it to them so they can get it in on time.

Even this thoughts seem very far fetched they can is still possible they can become true.

"As an artist, I am constantly developing and honing my skills to create something beautiful, meaningful, and authentic. To be able to do this well, I have had to develop a particular talent for observing the world around me and using my creativity to transform it into something special. This process starts when I take notice of the details of the world around me - birds singing, the warmth of sun on my skin, the colors of the evening sky – and is then translated into my artwork. 

Developing and using this skill has given me an ability to capture the beauty of my everyday life as well as a profound appreciation for my surroundings. Knowing how to spot the details, to pay attention to the subtleties of nature and life, helps me to craft powerful, meaningful pieces that express my true self.

In addition to my observation skills, I also focus on the skill of self-expression. The process of creating a piece of artwork often takes me into a mental and spiritual place, where I can express more complex feelings and ideas that would be hard to convey in other ways. This form of self-expression allows me to formerly document emotions, experiences and ideas, in a tangible and creative way that can be shared with others. To make this process of self-expression most meaningful, I try to explore not only my thoughts and feelings, but also my values, goals and aspirations.

Drawing upon these skills have allowed me to make some truly incredible pieces of art, and has taught me to appreciate all the details of life in an entirely new way. By honing my observations and expressing my ideas through art, I have been able to discover my true self and make a strong connection to my life and the world around me.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"During the summer leading up to my eighth grade year, my mom suggested that I get involved in an extracurricular activity because they are very beneficial for kids.

I thought for a while, then took her advice and decided to play on my high school's junior varsity football team.

When the practices first started that July, things were running pretty smoothly;however, once the school year started a couple of weeks later, things got a quite a lot tougher.

I had to learn to be responsible in order to keep up with my homework every day after practice.

As the season went on, I learned a lot of stuff about football and school, but most importantly, I had lots of fun doing it.

I am so glad that I took my mom's advice about extracurricular activities being beneficial to kids because I found that to be true for me as well.

Consequently, I agree with the decision that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

First, I think all students should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches students new, real world skills.

There are countless numbers of valuable techniques in the world today that are never taught within a classroom, but are needed for a successful career.

For example, when I played football, I learned the importance of working together on a team with other people.

When we all learned to work as one team, we started to play really good and win games.

On the other hand, if someone goes all throughout school and never learns the skill of teamwork, it is likely that they will not be very successful when they enter the real world because teamwork is an important skill that is needed in almost every job.

Just imagine if you are a business owner or employer and are looking for a person that you can hire to work for you.

Would you choose the person who was never involved in any type of after school or extracurricular activity, or would you choose the person who was very productive and was involved in many different activities throughout their schooling?

You would probably choose the one who was very involved in their school because that shows you that they have the skills needed to work for you and can keep up with a job.

Secondly, everyone should be involved in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to be responsible with their work.

Most kids today don't want to do their homework, and instead only do the fun stuff like play on their phones or lay on the couch like a sleeping bear, which usually results in bad grades.

However, being involved in an activity teaches students that if they want to have fun and stay in their club, they must do their work before anything else.

For example, during football season, I had to be extremely responsible with my schoolwork and grades, or else my coach could have kicked me off of the team.

Similarly, being responsible can also be a key characteristic of getting into college or the workforce.

Just like how you have a low chance of getting hired if you don't have the skills, you have an even lower chance of getting a job if you can't be responsible and maintain your job very well.

Some of the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the most talented or have the most skills, but they are able to keep up with all their work and maintain their position.

Lastly, extracurricular activities teach students how to have fun while doing something productive.

As mentioned earlier, students these days only like to do the fun stuff, not the work.

Extracurricular activities give kids the chance to have loads of fun, but also learn valuable lessons.

As a result of the activities being fun, students will also be more likely to stay in their club because they enjoy it, which helps both the students and the teachers get along better.

Additionally, most students will go away from a class and only remember the fun things that they did in it, while they will forget about all the important stuff.

But in extracurricular classes, the fun parts of the class will usually directly relate to profitable skills or morals, so that when students remember the fun stuff, they will also remember the skills that they learned as well.

For example, one day during football practice, our coach had us do a fun drill where we got to run behind our blockers.

I vividly remember this because it was really exciting when I got to do it, although, when I think about it, I also remember that in order to do it, I had to get low and run with the proper technique.

It was because of fun things like that drill that I was able to stick with the game and improve my skills.

So as you can see, I agree with the decision that all kids should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

Just like how I had to alter my work schedule when I played football, extracurricular activities might not be that easy, but I can promise you that in the long run, they are worth participating in.

So even if you don't think extracurricular activities are good for you, go ahead and just give one a try.

There are all sorts of activities out there that are available to everyone, so all you need to do is find the one that strikes your fancy.

I guarantee that you will not regret it at all!",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME im from SCHOOL_NAME .Some of my friends think having community serves is not a good job because that take time away from what you are doing for that day. For an example u have a basketball game u want to go to it and u have community servas and you cant play because u have community servas.,but i think u should not help the community servos i think u can do something else like recycling.

Another reasons why i think you should not have community servos is because that is tacking time out from your parents from working and from kids doing what they got to do. Some of the reasons why imp saint u should not have community sevens is because if u have to go some were special you have to do community serves have some question i will like to ask, how do it feel like doing community servos its like torcha? How it is in the summer time and you have 2 do that and it is like a 95 degree weather? What made mall come up with the idea of doing community serves? You do that for people who deserve it or what? What is the confluences if u do it or you don't do it?

The reasons why imp asking you all of these questions is because i wannabe know how do the system work with community serves. Also i want to know why is it community servants that's my option for this fit of having community servos.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Texting and driving has been the cause of so many deadly accidents, looking down at your phone for what you think is just a second could change your life forever. So many die every day from a car crashed caused by texting and driving. Whether it's you doing it or someone else on the road it could still change your life forever. Its so sad to think that you could lose your life at any moment while being in a car just riding down the road and get hit by someone that is on their phone while they are driving. If you are in the car with someone and they are on their phone, ask them to put it down... save a life or even your own life.

It's so sad to know that there are people out there that are that selfish to be on their phone while they are driving and not fully understand the consequences of it. The law enforcement here these last couple of years have really buckled down on the no phone while operating a vehicle law. They have just recently passed a law that you cant even have your phone on person while driving. If you get pulled over and you have it anywhere around you, you can get a big ticket. It's not even worth it in my opinion, the text or call can wait.

The newer vehicles are making them now where you can connect them through Bluetooth on your phone and send messages and calls through just saying it over the speaker. I have an older model Malibu, and it doesn't have all of the fantsy stuff but it does have Bluetooth and ""ONstar"" which is where you can call and talk over the phone instead of being on your phone. So many people I know have been in wrecks and the cause of it are phones. Phones are addicting and I want to be on mine all the time, but I know when I'm driving I don't need to be on mine because I can barely focus on the road much less my phone and the road.

My down the line cousin got in a wreck and killed someone for a couple of reasons, one being the cause of having the phone up to his hear. This young girl was coming back from college in Cartersville, and my cousin was driving coming back from his friends house and he wasn't paying attention to see the girl coming and pulled out right in front of her, and killed her. They saw that one of the causes was because of cell phone use and other things that were in his system... and he got charged with vehicular homicide. Which is killing someone while driving. My cousin is not a killer at all but he was on the phone while he was driving and killed someone from not having his full attention on the road.

Cars are really dangerous anyway, and hard to control sometimes, and adding a phone in that equation doesn't make sense. Some people do drugs they are illegal, but it's a matter of not caring, and being addicted. That's kind of the same thing about the texting and driving. Some people just don't care, and some just are too addicted to get off of it while they are driving. I'm not saying I am a perfect angel myself because I have been on my phone while I've been driving before but I don't do it often, because I know what it can do and cause, and that's not what I want at all.

"After conducting extensive research on the effects of a four-day work week on businesses, it has become clear that there are multiple advantages, such as improved focus, flexibility, and job satisfaction among employees. In addition, a four-day school week can provide more time for teaching and more space for students to do their homework. Although there are potential benefits to the change, there are also possible disadvantages. For example, students may miss out on classes or be unable to keep up with the curriculum and homework. It is also worth investigating how inadequate sleep can affect students and how a four-day school week would help address that issue. Ultimately, a thorough exam of the implications of extending the four-day school week has the potential to make significant improvements to the educational experience for students.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"I beileve the tecnology of ""Driverless"" cars is necessary in todays society, and should be used for its worth. One of the few big ideas i saw in the article was the newer use of sensors in the vehicles we use today. Many of the sensors today are used to warn and stop the driver from any collisions or accidents that may accure, at any moment. I beileve that this technology is needed now more than ever for everyone, and not just unexperienced or handicaped drivers. I am currently still learning how to drive and will get my license very, and i am very cautious of my peers driving too. I would feel more comfortable that the car could stop itself wiith out the drivers noticing, and possibly stoping to stop a collision or save my very own life. I would very much like to see this technology come to fruition, and let the world harness it's abilities to further mankind towards a safer and better future.

The laws aginst the use of these ""Driverless"" cars are very reasonable too, and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws. I beileve they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step foward, for safety, and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings. They don't seem to understand that these technologies are being invented to help save people today. If you searched on the internet for just one second you could find all sorts of stories, about their own cars saving the drivers from creating a terrible mistake and saving their lives. These laws make me question us, as a society, more than ever, and as a society how are we allowed to grow in knowledge and sciences, if we cannot test our ideas? We must further sucome to the new technologies we have available, at this time, but we must not lose ourselves in context. We have to push towards breaking these laws aginst testing and accept the new technology, for the future.

As a child i watched cartoons with flying cars and cities in space, and in todays age we have the ability to strive for this dream of the future. One day I hope to be sitting in a cab that s driving itself perfectly fine and not releasing large amounts of toxins into the air that we all breath, to survive. This is yet another thing to admire of these ""driverless"" cars, and that is the ability to use much less amounts of fuel, rather than traditional vehicles. As you may already know cars pushout lots of burned fossil fuels, but with the new technology that has been presented, these cars can use less fossil fuels. The burning of less fossil fuels is a ""thumbs up"", and has a lesser impact on the world, rather than a world without them.

I gladly accept the new technologies that ""Driverless"" cars have presented to me today, and feel safer knowing a computer system can save me from human errors. I can guarentee that this technology is safe and efficient for the world, and should be further studied to further the new technology to more suit society. The further interest or study in new sensor technology is to thank, just as much as the fuel concerns we have today with our own vehicles. The technology of the future is here, and we need it to help save the lives of many people. We as the society of the future should not stand back and watch the possibilities of our future be restricted by laws, that just dont understand the purpose of this technology. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a significant change in the way we learn and work. One of the most significant changes has been the shift towards online learning. While attending classes in person has its advantages, there are also benefits to attending classes online. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits and responsibilities of attending classes online instead of attending classes in person.

Firstly, attending classes online provides students with more flexibility and convenience. Students can access course materials and lectures at any time, allowing them to balance their studies with other responsibilities such as work or family commitments. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for students who have to work part-time or full-time jobs to support themselves or their families. For example, a single mother who works full-time can attend online classes in the evenings or on weekends, allowing her to provide for her family while also pursuing her education.

Secondly, attending classes online can be more cost-effective than attending classes in person. Online courses often have lower tuition fees and do not require students to purchase textbooks or other materials. Additionally, students can save money on transportation, housing, and other expenses associated with attending classes in person. For example, a student who lives far from the university can attend online classes and save money on transportation and housing costs.

However, attending classes online also comes with responsibilities. Students must be self-motivated and disciplined to attend online classes and complete assignments on time. They must also have access to reliable internet and technology, which may not always be available in some areas. Furthermore, students may miss out on the social interactions and support that come with attending classes in person. For example, students may not have the opportunity to form study groups or connect with classmates who share their interests.

In conclusion, attending classes online has both benefits and responsibilities. While it provides students with more flexibility and convenience, it also requires self-motivation and discipline. However, the benefits of attending classes online can outweigh the responsibilities, especially for students who have to balance their studies with other responsibilities. For example, a single mother who works full-time can attend online classes and provide for her family while also pursuing her education. Furthermore, attending classes online can be more cost-effective than attending classes in person, which can be especially beneficial for students who live far from the university or have financial difficulties.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As an average 8th grade student, I find the topic of character traits and their development over time fascinating. It's interesting to think about how different individuals can have different traits, and how these traits can be influenced by various factors such as environment, society, and internal factors.

For example, some people may be naturally more outgoing and sociable, while others may be more introverted and reserved. The environment and society can also play a role in shaping these traits. For instance, someone who grows up in a bustling city may be more likely to develop a more outgoing personality, while someone who grows up in a small town may be more reserved.

But it's not just the environment and society that can influence character traits. Internal factors, such as a person's values and beliefs, can also play a role. For instance, someone who values independence and self-reliance may be more likely to develop a more self-sufficient personality.

I think it's also interesting to consider how individuals can change their traits over time. For example, someone who used to be shy and introverted may work on becoming more outgoing and confident, and eventually develop a more extroverted personality. This can be seen in people who undergo personal transformations, such as those who go through a spiritual awakening or who make significant changes in their lives.

However, it's important to note that while people can make changes to their traits, they are not completely in control of them. External forces, such as societal expectations and cultural norms, can also play a role in shaping a person's character. For instance, someone who grows up in a culture that values extroversion may feel pressure to be more outgoing and sociable, even if they are naturally more introverted.

In conclusion, character traits are complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors. While people have some control over their traits, external forces can also play a significant role in shaping them. Understanding how character traits develop over time can provide insight into a person's character and how it develops over time.",1,llama2_chat,1
"In the story the author gives us reasonable decisions on why we should go to Venus. It forms like earth and its clled the Earth? twin sister. The author provides a lot of information. One of them states ¨

may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago,Venus was probably covered laregley with oceans and coul have supported various forms of life¨ this cold very well be a lot like earth. There are sea level just like earth and there ¨ familiar features such as valleys ,mountains,and craters.¨These areall the same thing that Earth has,It also says that this Venus could have very well had ocean covering all of it.

This could go both wasy this could very well be a successful mission or it could be a very dangerous and unsure mission. That are traking research and countinuing finding more ways to make sure that humans will not have any problems while living in Venus.

"The accomplishments of Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Leonardo da Vinci have had an immense impact on society, leaving an indelible mark on our history and culture. These renowned individuals triumphed over obstacles in both physical and intellectual endeavors, paving the way for ground-breaking discoveries in the fields of science, philosophy, and the arts. What made them stand out was their ability to think outside the box and push themselves to explore unexplored areas. For instance, Newton developed his groundbreaking laws of motion, while Shakespeare wrote some of the most renowned works of literature in history.

Although it is difficult to pinpoint any one factor that led to their success, it is clear that in order for people to flourish intellectually, they must be provided the right combination of stimulation and encouragement. For instance, teachers and mentors can help their students cultivate inquisitiveness and be courageous in tackling new challenges. The right environment can motivate individuals to think beyond conventional methods and put their creative skills to use. Furthermore, knowledge sharing and collaboration also plays an essential role, as it creates an environment wherein the exchange of ideas can result in amazing discoveries.

Finally, while new discoveries can have positive effects on society, they can also have unintended consequences. It is therefore necessary to take appropriate measures to ensure that the process of invention and innovation occurs responsibly. To ensure this, proper research should be conducted before any discovery is put to use, and the consequences must be studied to ensure that they are beneficial to society.

In conclusion, Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Leonardo da Vinci are prime examples of individuals who rose above their circumstances and pushed themselves to explore new ideas and create lasting change. It is necessary to provide the right combinations of motivation and support to encourage people to think beyond conventional boundaries and make new discoveries. In addition, these discoveries must be made responsibly, with the proper research and precautions being taken to ensure that the changes are in the best interest of society.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Working in a group versus working alone has its pros and cons. Working in a group can be beneficial in many ways, such as encouraging collaboration, providing different perspectives, and improving problem-solving skills. Collaboration can be a great experience as it encourages compromise and provides another layer of understanding. Working in a group can also stimulate the open exchange of ideas among members of the group, resulting in different perspectives from which to consider a solution to a problem. Additionally, multiple minds working on the same challenge can improve problem-solving skills and can create a better work product.

On the other hand, working alone can be difficult because of the lack of collaboration, the stagnant ideas, and the pressure to work at a faster pace. When working alone, there is no one to bounce ideas off of, leading to stagnant ideas as no new perspectives are introduced. Moreover, when working alone, the individual is expected to work at a faster pace and can result in rushed work product.

Working in a group can be especially helpful to students. Working in a group can alleviate some of the pressures associated with an academic project, such as the fear of being the only one who does not understand the material or the fear of not completing the assignment on time. Additionally, working in a group can also promote sharing of resources and responsibility as group members can share the workload and knowledge. Group settings also bring opportunities to ask for help, learn, and build relationships.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Driverless cars have more cons and disadvantages then they do pros and advantages. The author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" presents positive and negative aspects of driverless cars but I really only see the negatives. If there are driverless cars, then there could be a lot more crashes then there already are. Driverless cars are pointless and show a great amount of negatives, show that no one in the car will be paying attention, and there are so many safety issues.

First, there are many negatives regarding driverless cars. Technology in the future may be able to have cars without a driver at all. In the article though, the author states that currently they would not be truly driverless yet. The driver would still need to stay alert and be able to take over when needed, like driving through a work zone or when they are driving through an accident site. When a person is driving a car, they already need to be fully alert and know what is happening around them at all times to stay safe. If we have someone sitting in the drivers seat waiting to have to take control, then what is the point of not driving it when you pretty much need to continue to know what is going on at all times? There is always the fear that something will go wrong and the car just will not work right. This could cause serious injuries and even death to the driver and passengers in the driverless car as well as other cars and people around them. Another issue is that there is a lot of poverty and familes without enough money to buy a regular car. The amount of technology and work needed to make these driverless cars will put The United States of America in even more debt then they already are. As well as many other countries around the world. The cost for these driverless cars are a huge negative that will result in many people not being able to afford to buy them.

Secondly, when the car is driving without a driver but still has a driver in the drivers seat, the driver could be on their phone, reading something, or listening to music and not paying attention then all the sudden the car alerts them that they need to take over but they are not ready and do not know the reason why they are in the situation to take over the car. This could cause crashes and serious injuries to the driver and other passengers in their car, as well as people in cars around them. Nobody can promise that the driver will be able to pay attention at all times when the car is driving itself. It is kind of like having someone in the passenger seat, they are not driving so they are on their phones, reading stuff, and listening to music, not paying attention to the road. Same goes for a driver just sitting in the drivers seat and not driving the car. They could be not paying attention and then all the sudden they are surprised with the need to start driving in a situation they have not been paying attention to. In paragraph eight of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author expresses that they are trying to bring up in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-ups displays. The author states that this could be a safety feature, but who knows that will work perfectly, or that the driver will be entertained by that?

Lastly, the safety issues regarding the driverless cars could be an endless list. If the driver is not paying attention, like I expressed in the pervious paragraph, the issues with safety grow bigger then they already are with actual people driving cars. If the driver has no clue what is going on because they were on their phones, reading something, or listening to music and then suddenly they have to take over, this could cause a crash that could cause serious and minor injuries as well as death. The amount of crashes that happen today with actual humans driving cars are already through the roof, if something messes up with the driverless car, it could be very bad. It is just like how your phone can mess up randomly and stop working, what if that happens to the driverless car?

The author of the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" expresses both postive and negative aspects of driverlesscars. I believe that driverless cars have more negatives than positives and are pointless. They also show many safety issues that can put many people in danger and show financial disadvantages. In conclusion, driverless cars should not be a thing in order to keep everybody safe.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"When you live in the United States, you use cars everyday, so you wouldnt understand the positive impacts of limiting car usage has on everyday life. Some small towns in Germany, Paris, and Colombia are car-free citys. In the passage

In German Susburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , writen by Elisabeth Rosental, She tells her readers that a suburb in Germany, Vauban, has street parking, driveways, and home garages generally forbidden. Rosenthal states that not having a car can actually bring happiness. ""'When I had a car I was always tence. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walker.""

In the second article,

Paris bans dring do to smog , by Robert duffer, he tells the reader about the struggles Paris faced with polution in the air. He states that they made a system where one day they would have even licence plate number stay home one day and the odds would stay home the next. After trial and error, They came up with a solution, And it helped the smog go away. If cars were banned completly the air we breathe would be so much cleaner, and less foggy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescrind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

In the third passage

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , by Andrew Selsky, It talks about a car free day that takes place once a year in the town on Bogota. The passage also states that people hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work during the car free day. Selsky states that the goal of the day is to promote alternative transportation and reduse smog, Which brings back the fact that not using cars reduses polution in the ait. The other reson banning cars is a good idea is because it redused stess, because you dont have to deal with traffic, find a parking spot, or worry about being late to work because you have to stop to fill up your tank in the morning. ""'It's a good oppotunity to take away stress...' said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza""

The last article the End of Care Culture , written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, talks about how ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". i beleive people are finally coming to the state of mind where public transportation is the faster, easier, and more afisiant way. Another reason it is better than having your own cars is that it is safer. ""'...public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resousrces, lower emissions and improve safety.""

The main advantages of limiting car usages are happiness, lower in polution, lower in stress, and increase in safety.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"DEAR,state senator i argue in favor of keeping  the electoral votes alive to choose for the new turn. people say that the electoral voting system may turn alot of potential voters away from voting for a new president since the electoral voting has been tight on alot of people who don't like to use that way then they want it as a direct election and to abolish the electoral college!

There are alot of ways we can actually save the eletoral voting system .the electoral voting consists of a very non-democratic way so all the voters can decide on a canindate for whoever receives the most highest votes on,in 2000 gore had way more votes than bush but fewer electoral votes on him andthat was since they first ever voting for the presidents back in around 1888 thats a very long time almost 200 years when that happened. basically we need to keep the electoral voting for some practical reasons thta we do not know about now maybe it could be from thedispute over recent years of voting .

"Dear state senator,

I trying to understand why we have the system of choosing our state's electors when you vote for president beacuse when you vote for your candidant you are actualy voting for your candidante's electors. This process is easier for most individuals beacause you do not have to sit in a room, for hours, counting up millions of votes; all you have to do is count up the elector's votes in stead. This process is what our founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. How can you be a qualified citizen, arent we all the same? I know that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. So, another thing that I would like to know is do you believe that this process that has been going on for ages is still a acturate system.

Does voting for people to vote for the president of your choice is a great idea. Does it not seem a bit ludacris that you have to choose your state electors in order for your vote to be counted since you think that who you pick as the electors will actually pick the vote you wanted. Why cant we vote for our won presient, why should we have to go through someone to vote for our president. It has been known that president's may be the popular vote winner, but still can lose the presidency. Why is that? Individuals that vote on their electors can not always control who their electors choose for president. Occasionally, sometimes the electors you pick will not vote for his or her party's candidate; they will cast a vote for whomever they please.

Some of these candidates that people choose are what you call ""faithless"" electors because of the winner-takes-all system. This means that most candidates do not spend time in states they know that they have no chance of winning. Meaning, they only stay focused on the ""swing"" states which in other words means the states that will either go for the person they like or against him. During the 2000 campaign, 17 state had not even seen their candidates at all and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not get to see a single campaign ad. So, tell me why we are still using this same system that cheats citizens out of their votes. Is it beacuse we are not qualified citizens?

If you do not already know by now the electoral college is a process, not a place and this process needs to be abolished. Who picks these electors, are they just people like you and I or are they the qualified citizens. They can be anyone not holding an office and the state actually chooses the electors. So, this means that the people really have no place in the president election. The electors are chosen by the state and even if you choose those electors they can go against what you decide and choose who ever they want. What happened to what the people wanted, why are those candidates choosing who runs our country for four years. What did they do so amazing that they get the final say on the matter. No, they are like us so why should we have to go through them just so we can make sure are vote matters in electing the president. Most of America has to deal with making sure are kids are getting a good eduacation, making sure are water or light bill is paid every month, and we also have deal with getting up at seven in the morning working and not coming home untill eleven at night all the while praying that our kids are safe since we could not pay for a nanny. With all of these things worrying us, putting a lot of stress in our minds one of the only things that we should not have to worry about is if our vote is going to count in electing our president. In conclusion, I believe, senator, that we should change our election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear principal,

I believe that allowing student to bring phones to school and using them during lunch period and free time but as long as the phones are off during class time is a bad idea because what if the student don't listen to the policy and they have there phones out during classes and there texting during there class and when the teacher ask what is the answer to ""2836/847 they don't the answer how they be able to learn. Here's an example I think I can bring my phone to school and text, call, go on the internet go on facebook do what ever i want do and if it goes to far. That student will start to fail school and not doing the homework. That student will start going to classes. Then start skip school her so cool and popular. I also believe don't allow student to have phone at school at all is another bad idea because what if student needs to call home call someone else what if a group of student are walking to school and someone got shot how would they call the police if there phones are at home that student will be dyeing right before the other students eye what would you do. So here's policy 3 the student are allow to bring they phones to school but at all time it has to be turned off and in your locker inside your book bag.

"Bullying is a major issue in today's society. It affects millions of people, and it can have severe consequences on the mental and physical health of the victim. Bullying can take many forms, such as verbal abuse, physical violence, and cyberbullying. It is essential to find ways to prevent bullying and offer solutions to those affected by it.

The first step in preventing bullying is to promote respect for each other. Respect is a fundamental human right, and it is essential to treat everyone with kindness and compassion. People should be encouraged to listen to others and understand their feelings and perspectives. By promoting respect, we can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.

Another way to prevent bullying is to educate people about its impact. Many people do not realize the harm that bullying can cause, and they may not understand how to recognize or respond to it. By educating people about the effects of bullying, we can help them identify and address it when it occurs.

In addition to prevention, it is essential to offer solutions to those affected by bullying. For victims, it is important to provide them with a safe and supportive environment. This can include counseling services, peer support groups, and other resources that can help them cope with the emotional and psychological effects of bullying.

It is also important to address the root causes of bullying. Many people bully because they feel powerless or insecure, and they may be seeking attention or validation. By addressing these underlying issues, we can help people find alternative ways to express themselves and build healthy relationships.

Finally, people can have fun without resorting to violence. There are many ways to have fun and socialize without engaging in bullying or other harmful behaviors. This can include participating in sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities, volunteering, or simply spending time with friends and family.

In conclusion, preventing bullying and offering solutions to those affected by it is essential for creating a safe and inclusive society. By promoting respect, educating people about the impact of bullying, addressing the root causes of bullying, and offering solutions to victims, we can help create a more positive and supportive environment for everyone.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a world with not a lot of car usage? Imagine never driving but walking or ridding a bike to any place you would want to go to. The mall, grocery store, movies all a small walking distance away. That would be great right? You'd be helping yourself and the world by making you fit and the world's pollution decrees. That sound interesting I feel like the world is slowly coming to a stopping point with car use.

A world with cleaner air is what we would have if everyone limited the use of their cars. According to "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states."" The United States produces a greater amount of greenhouse gasses. If we limited the use of our cars the United States would have better air making the United States a better place to live. The United States has a very large number of people already pulling away from using cars. According to "" The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal."" Americans are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Cars are not needed for everyday use because people seem to get around greatly.

Limiting the use of you care can greatly help everyone. The United States has a very large amount of unhealthy people. People who don't get to walk or do fitness regularly to be able to stay healthy and fit. Having limited the use of your car it would as help you mentally. In the article ""In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal Heidrun Walter a mother of two says "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" If a mother of two says that not using her car makes her happier. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" by Andrew selsky a businessman said "" It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" So if you ask me the would would be better without using cars everyday it's a win win situation.

People all around the world are taking part in limiting the use of cars. People from Colombia to Pairs to Germany. People all over the word are all trying to help out the world by limiting the use of cars. In the article "" Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky the author talks about how everyone took a ""car free"" This was Bogota's third straight year of no car day the only cars that were allowed to be on the road were those of busies or taxis. The violators that drove their car are faced with a fine of $25. In the text of ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. She says that the worlds car culture is slowly coming to a end fewer people are getting their licenses and more are organizing their social lives and summer jobs around where they could was or take a buss to.

The world is on a better path with people trying to limit the use of their cars. The world gets better and so do you. In the articel ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky says that the business in the small town have also boomed "" Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restraints and up scale shopping districts have cropped up."" So if everyone limited the use of their cars the everyone would win. So what comes now that the world is limiting the use of cars?    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Wyat Gibson, former scientist from NASA, 1976. Today, spacecraft one has captured a image to what looks to appear as a face. Scientist figured it was just another Martain mesa. ""Only this one photo had unusaul shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharoh."" I predicted that it must have a degree of surpise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion lab when the face appeared on the monitiors.

Some other scientist belived the face was an alien artfact. I snapped a picture ten times sharper than the oraginal Viking photos. I have done lots of reaserch, and revealed a natural landform. I reasched the photo a lot more. After a lot of rearch, I decoved that there was no alien monument after all.

We decieded that we still did not have enough evedience. Perhaps, alien markings were hidden by haze. Still there is no evedience as we continued. After more and more reasch. There is still no alien monument.

We decovered that the picture is acually the Martian of a butte or mesa. They are landforms common around the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about that same height as the face on mars. In the end, there was not evedience of alien lifeform or artcraft.

"Dear principle,

I think community service is very important to our city because many cities are filthy and dirty and need cleaning, if we can get the whole school to do it, it would be great, and it would also become a good opportunity for our city, but i don't think it would be fair if the whole school is forced to do it, i would prefer if you were to make a list so people are free to sign up if they want to join community service.

Another example why community service shouldn't be highly instructed is because some kids might have some important things to do at home and might not have free time to help the community. Also not many kids have time to help because of all their homework and chores they might have at home.

The list would be an excellent idea because the people that sign up would most likely have time to help and would probobly be dedicated to doing community service. Although not many people would be doing community service you would know that the people that signed up are a dedicated group of people and would be glad to help.

Many people don't know all the pollution that is out there is killing animals and slowly destroying our planet' soon our planet will be completely a mess and would be a horrible place to live. Many people don't believe in global warming but there has been some evidence of global warming. One piece of evidence is there has been a major decrease in water. The water level is lowering and will soon be completely gone, witch will then lead to death.

Many people argue about this but all this pollution is doing a lot of harm to all the living things in the world. these are some of many reasons why we need community service so i hope you take my advice and use it for future reference.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Cars are becoming a must in today's society. In some places, people live and survive without a motorized vehical. People don't have to stop using cars altogether, but should be able to limit themselves to save of world from pollution creating a better environment to live in.

Some people don't understand the severity of pollution and how much cars contribute to that. Pollution is said to become Earths demise, whith cars producing and letting out so much smog, it seems as if the Earths demise could be near. According to Robert Duffer, Paris has ""enfored a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This evidence of Paris giving a partial ban shows how detrimental cars can have on Earth environment. Further examination reveals, a situtation where Bogota has even issued a "" car-free day"" stated by Andrew Selsky. This source shows us that with even one day without using a car could be a useful plan for all places. People of today don't need to not use their cars, just use their cars either less per day or per week.

Although some may say, we need cars to get to work or to go to the grocery store, they can always just use public transportation. Buses are already running even if you are in a car so why not use them instead of polluting the air even more. In Bogota, when they have their car-free day, most people either ""hiked"",""biked"", ""skated"" or ""took buses"" as a mean of transportation. More evidence shows a senario where the Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging a ""car reduced"" community, stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Resources such as this one shows that if the United States Evironmental Protection Agency is concerned about our pollution rate why shouldn't we? If we cut down on our use of cars, pollution rate can drop extremley down causing a better living environment.

When you stop to think why cars have become so prevelant, there is no exact reasoning. If we don't even know our exact reasoning for having a car, in a case that we can't rely on buses or our own two legs to provided why are we risking the safty of our Earth in order to use them? Cars aren't the slighest bit the problem, how and how often we use them is becoming the problem, if we limit our use of cars our advantage would be the single best thing in live, happiness and peace of life.             ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Summer is a time for students to relax with the little time that they have off from school. Some people think that kids do nothing over the summer, and they forget everything. Which is not beneficial for when they come back to school. Even teachers having the authority to assign summer projects is not okay in my opinion. If their has to be projects done over the summer it would be better for them to be student-designed.

The whole point of a ""summer break"" is to not have to do any work, we finally have time during the week to do other things then go to school. By not doing work over the summer you are not forgetting everything you learned because some of the stuff we actually use in out everyday lives. And even if we don't, we still wouldn't forget we would just need a little refresher on some topics. Which is what most schools do anyways when the kids get back. And even if we did the project at the beginning of the summer, most students wouldn't remember what the project was on. If the teachers were given the authority to assign the summer projects most kids would not do it. Some would forget, or simply just not want to because it is summer break. Kids are traveling and don't always have the time to be focusing on school. Even if parents were contacted about this workload, I believe that students will take it upon themselves to not to it at all. If there was an option to do summer work or not I feel that, the students that want to do better will do that work. Maybe having a prize, extra credit, an automatic test exemption, or something would influence students to pick their choice wisely.

A student-designed project would be the best option out of those two things. Because as students we don't like to feel restricted on what we can and can't do with all of the guidelines. Student-designed projects could benefit each person and make every student feel more comfortable with what they are doing These projects would be a great thing to start off the school year with because they could be about their summer break and what they did. And instead of the ice breaker games that everyone in each class has to do, they could simply just share their project that they decided to do over the break. This option would also be a huge stress reliever on the teachers workload, with deciding what each person has to do.

Some people would say otherwise. That the kids need projects to keep them on target for the year. Or to already be practicing for their classes for next year. That it can only benefit us in our life. Parents could say that they will make time for their children work and remind them of what they have to do for school even on the break. Also that teachers guidelines would restrict the work to something appropriate, or meaningful to school.

In the end I feel that it is all up to the students and what they want to work on. Because as highschoolers self accountability is a real thing. The school already provides summer school and sol remediation over the summer for free that you can sign up for. So if a student is worried about their grades in a class or wants to get ahead they already can through those programs. Or even taking classes outside of the school with tutors. These projects could be a really good and efficient thing or a stressful unmotiving thing. And that would be all up to the school and administrators.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear principal

I agree we should clean up the entry school in end up clean like a whistle. The principal should lets take some breaks once for a while. When school is over we should stay at school until 5:00 p. m. therefore cleaning up the liter and stuff off the ground and throw it away in the trash can. We should have a break at 3: 50 to 4:15 p. m. that gives us plenty of time for a break.

But, let some people to go home so they can watch some of their favorite shows and play their video games. Once for a while they will come back help us because they did all their chores and their's nothing on TV. I will go home because I have to do chores and feed my animals. Plus sometimes I might have a bad day and want to get away from people. In a few minutes I would get over with it come back to school to make it better.

I don't want anybody to come to this school and say "" This school doesn't look right because all this litter and trash all around the campus "", I would get up change the school picking up piece by piece unit it the cleanest school in Jefferson Davis County. We also need to clean the walls , decorated the school parking lots and cafeteria. We should build a new break room full with snack bars, soda machines, and rooms for people so they can talk on break. It would be good if you give us a break between Ist and 2nd. We could reorganize the gym because a lot people are trash behind after the game is over. We could put a trash can on the stands so the when the people leave out the gym it would be a little clean.

"Phones and Driving

Over 400,000 casualties occur annually due to distractions while driving (Vegega, pg 3). Many of these distractions are due to phones, an ever-growing distraction for drivers. Due to this risk drivers should not be able to use phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because of the growing threat towards drivers and pedestrians and potential cost of damages.

Since recent years phones have been a more common distraction for drivers. Growing distractions such as the usage of cellular devices poses a threat to drivers. From 2012 to 2015 crashes involving cell phones have increased by 15% from roughly 60,000 to 69,000 (NHTSA, pg 3). Therefore the usage of cellular devices while driving has led to a growing threat for drivers. Furthermore, distractions while driving also poses a risk to pedestrians. Of the 3450 fatalities in the US during 2016 caused by car crashes due to distractions 462 (13%) are pedestrians (NHTSA, pg 3). This means distractions such as cell phone usage put pedestrians at serious risk when a car crash occurs. Overall, cell phone usage while driving poses a growing danger toward drivers and pedestrians.

Phone usage while driving can cost vast amounts for both governments and drivers. Damaged caused by crashes due to distractions is expensive to replace or repair. In 2010 the cost of damage due to distracted drivers was $22 billion, which is about $26 billion in 2019 (Vegega, pg 3). This data reveals that car crashes due to distractions cost countries billions to remedy, an expense which far outweigh any positives. In addition, drivers also risk paying fines for cell phone usage. In states such as Delaware fines can cost upwards of $50 and come with court fees upwards of $100 (Chaudhary, pg 3). This means that drivers can face severe financial penalties due to cell phone usage while driving. In brief, the financial cost of crashes due to distractions far outweigh the benefits of cell phone use.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use phones in capacity while operating a vehicle due to the risk towards drivers and pedestrians and enormous financial cost. While driving, drivers are exposed to many types of distraction however, distractions such as phones are in complete control of the driver.

"""Benefits of Online schools""

Students should attend online classes, for there are more benefit and opportunity for students than there are at school.

Online school include many benefits like higher chance of grade, having much more time on your schedule, and a faster way to receive credit for the class.

Online school increases student's time, so they can save more time and set up their schedule to get important things done and be able to go other places. Many students work especially in high school and college. Some students quite their job or stop going to school, for their work schedule and school schedule don't match. Also, Online schools are helpful for unemployed students, who want to volunteer or participate in sports. Instead of going to school, students are able to go on a vacation in different countries or visit their relatives in different states, by taking online classes. In conclusion, schools waste many students time and stop them from volunteering, working, and traveling by taking much of their time, for not all students have the same schedule or daily routine.

Schools can be distracting and frustrating for many students, but online classes help students have more silent and focusing environment, which helps them keep their grade up. Many fights or argument occur at school, for some students don't get along. For example, someone's conversation or actions can be distracting to others, for there are students, who truly want to learn their lesson while there are students who don't. On the other hand, some students work late at night and don't get enough sleep because they have to go to school early in the morning. Eventually, they end up receiving low grade for sleeping in the class and not being able to focus on the lesson. By taking online classes, students understand and learn the lesson better by repeating or reread the lesson online at home, where it's silent and less distracting. As a result, students receive higher grade attending online classes because students have more time to sleep, have more personal space, and it's much easier to learn online than at school.

One of the best benefits of online schools is that there are no delays, and students don't miss any lessons due to any weather condition, viruses, or sickness. Many schools cancel or delay due to heavy snow, hurricanes, or viruses. For example, schools in Generic_City are closing due to Corona virus. Besides, students, who have Corona or any other illness, don't miss any of their assignments or tests, for they can do them online while resting.

In conclusion, online schools are faster way for students to finish their class with high grade and without any missing assignment.

Some students might argue that going to school is much is easier than online schools, for you can ask your teacher questions and get personal help from them. They also might argue that you can't meet other students and discus the lesson with them attending online classes. Most of online classes contains teacher's email or there is a way to send a massage and ask questions relating to the lesson. Sometimes, there are group chats for students to attending the same online class to communicate and discus the lesson. But however, communication between students are not necessary or a way for students to learn more about the lesson. Though, being able to ask your teacher questions relating to the topic can be helpful.

Attending online class has many impact on student's time. Being able to get enough sleep and have your personal space, students can be focused, which helps them to keep their grade up and learn more about their lessons. last but not least, attending online class at anytime, students can do other things like working, going to vacation, and attending other classes or events keep them active. At last, students don't miss any assignment due to any delay or sickness. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Attention my fellow citizens, we should limit car usage  because limiting car usage will release stress, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, and stop smog.

First, we should limit car usage because driving a car can be stressful. For example say you just got finished with a hard day of work and it was not the best day, You hop in your car and when you start to drive you look ahead and see a trafic jam. After working all day, getting in a car to wait hours and hours to get home is not peaceful or fun. Another example would be when you're on the road and the people around you are not driving safely. ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happeir this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two.(In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 3)

Not only does the usage of cars cause stress but it also causes greenhouse gas. The use of cars should be limitted because we could drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 5) Using a car to get around is nice but isint living on earth better than driving a gas powered vehicle and slowly destroying the earth? ""All of our development since World War II has been on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transport for America.(P7)

Finally, We should limit the usage of cars because if we do we can stop smog. Smog is pollution that creates clouds all around and it is discusting and horrible for the earth. 'Bejing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(Paris bans driving due to smog, Paragraph 14) After intensifying smog, congestion was down 60 percent and thats only after 5 days thats incredible!

All in all, we should limit car usage because if we can use cars less than we do, it will ease stress, reduce greenhouse gas, and finally clean the earth. What do you say, use your car less and get some exersize? Thanks for reading my fellow citizens.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The neighboring planet to earth, known as Venus has been considered a land of danger. This however, does not stop astronaunts from searching for the unknown answers behind this magnificent planet. Venus represents itself hotter in tempature than Mercury (the closest planet), and is known not to be hospitible to any outside objects. This essay will be explaining few of the reasons why Venus is in fact an intresting discovery in the universe, and depict why it is yet so dangerous.

The first reason why Venus is a worthy pursuit towards the information it consist about, is because if NASA were able to test rocks and other materials, then it would impact the history of science. Science is an amazing attribute to society and if NASA could develop the technology to be able to enter the Venus atmostphere then all the lost questions will be answered. It is also, very similar to Earth.

If the danger of Venus could be determined to an exact pin point then we could use the results to fix and calculate other situations. Each time Earth as send a space aircraft to Venus, it had only lasted moment before it melted. If the substance could be tested then it would influence the world in a scientific way.

In conclusion, despite the critical mess of Venus, many people find it special and unique. The more scientist that get involved with making new technology to show Venus' value, can also help bring the world closer. This is true, because the more that are influenced are the more that will make a difference to society. If NASA exposes continually how similar Venus is to Earth then the way we look at things scientifically will conjure our thoughts ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Students should design these projects to let the teacher see how creative students can be. Also to show the diffrent ways students can use their mind to comlete the project in the course of the their break. In some cases students will not want to do any work over their break, but if these students can design the assignment and do what ever project they want to do they will be willing to do the work. Furthermore, students being able to design a project for the course of summer break will help students learn how to complete a task they assign themelves and will help students be able to set goals and accomplish them in the future.

This form of learning can assist students in being creative and opening up the mind to new things. Those qualitys help expand the information you know and can benefit you in the long run. These things form a intellegent mind thats why I feel its a need to try and do new things to learn. For example, there was a time when I was told by a teacher to try a new method in reading that I come up with because she said thats something to make you remember what youve just learned ,and ever since then I have always been open to new things and ideas when it comes to coming up with a new way of learning. Therefore, I always try to incourage others to do the same because its something that strenghtings you, opens the mind, and makes you a smarter individual.

Using your mind in diffrent ways stimulates students brains and Creates new pathways for information to be shared. This is a way to get a better understanding of ways you can look at certain situations as a student. For instance, you might not like the way things are going in class but if you were to sit and think of better ways to handle the problem it will show you that thinking in diffrent ways can make a problem a blessing you just have to be willing to put forth the effort. trying is better than not trying and that can make a big diffrence in your life and how you live it. It takes being diverse on how you think to become a great student.

Students creating their own project for their summer break is one of the best things you can get a student to do because they have to think and use diffrent ideas to complete a assignment that they choose. Its important to understand the importance of this because it will give them something to do to remember what they learned from school in the past year while they are on summer break, so they can't forget any information that is needed for years to come. Also will be alot easier for them to accomplish things in the future due to working in the summer nights through school and this will highly benefit the students and their future. Thats the reason I think this will be beneficial to anyone who attempts.

Another reason is that it will prepare the students for a heavy work load in years to come. For example, being in highschool and later going on to college is not just a walk in the park its hard days and long nights to accomplish something bigger. Students doing this at a young age will have them ready for the highschool and college lifestyle. Also will give them something they can never loose and thats the dicipline you get from doing obstacles like this because it keeps you from getting distracted and helps you focus harder on the project and they all starts with you aswell so its the dicipline you aquire from doing things like that.

In conclusion, students are required to design their own project they are to complete over the course of summer and create it by themselves. I agree with this because it can give the students important qualities that they only can get from doing something like a self made project and can benefit them for their future. Doing certain things in life are only to help you learn and grow and doing a project like this will help you be able to multitask and do things a different way then you see everyone else doing. Therefore students designing their own projects can help and benefit them to be a better individuals in the future.                                                                                                                                                          ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Generic_City is a vibrant city located in the western region of Uzbekistan with a long and rich history. It was founded around 2000BC by the ancient Silk Road traders, and due to its strategic location has been a major point of exchange and commerce for centuries. Throughout its long history, the city has seen the rise and fall of numerous empires, with each one leaving their mark on the town.

Today, Generic_City is an architectural gem, filled with ancient forts, mosques and palaces representing the various cultures and kingdoms which have called this city home. From its soaring domes and minarets to the vibrant floral designs adorning its walls, Generic_City’s buildings offer a time capsule into the past.

Just as diverse as the city’s architecture is its food. The city’s traditional cuisine is a unique blend of Persian, Indian and Chinese flavors, served with local spices such as cumin and coriander. From the tender plov (boiled rice with meat) to the delicate samsa (samosa-like pastry parcels), Generic_City’s food represents a rich tapestry of flavors. Visitors to Generic_City can experience a journey through time, culture and flavor.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1) I believe strongly that we should keep the electoral college, beacuse it keeps people from directly voting for a presdient,keeps everything even and mostlikely fair. Most people think that we should get rid of the electoral college,its clearly a state of opinion.

When you really sit down and think about how most people vote in the Northeast and South they are not the thoughtful voters. (said in paragraph 19 line 2 paragraph 4) Take obama for an example, he was the first black presidental canidate and most of the darker skined group of people got excited because for the first time in history a black man could be president,many blacks thought that voting for the black president would mean that they would better respersatition in office,so many blacks and some whites voted for obama to win. Not really paying much attention to what or who they were voting for. Which you could probably figure out that obama won they had the bigger vote. If we are able to keep the electoal college it would mean that wouldnt happen agian because it could go through the electorals they would choose who is best. Dont get me wrong people actually voted for obama anyways ,because of what he  stood for but most didn't.

In reality most people think that the voting is unfair, like what happened with Presidnet Kennedy. Kennedy was the stronger, better canidate to be president. I believe that the electors chose right, it may not have been who the people wanted. He was way better then Nixon could ever be. That may have made the people very mad,which led to the assination of President Kennedy. Kenndey changed the country and to this day in my mind, known as one of the best presdidents we ever had. Thanks to the electoral system we had Kennedy elected instead of Nixon,could you just imagine how the country would be today. If Kennedy didnt win,or if Nixon was president just one little thing could change everything. Everything happens for a reason and having the electoral college helps. I know that Nixon has the popular vote but kennedy needed to win for the better of our country,its my state of opinion.

Most people think that having the electoral college is bad,why? because they believe that the people should be able to vote directly. I understand how and why they believe that. When you think about votin directly it would insure the people that whoever they are voting for they would be sure to get thier votes and for sure get the president that they wished to be president. I could truley undertsand why and this would work out, but i still strongly believe that this could be the cause to many problems.

In conclusion,I beleive that we shoudl keep the electoral college becaue he keeps the people for choosing a president direlcetly. If they make a bad chose someone,who knows is the better canidate that they could over rule the peoples vote. So it would all fair in most turns and would possibably helping the country,and many people believe otherwise its truely a state of opinion. You choose who chooses the president.

"There is some consensus of when it comes to if student should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Although some people think student should not take online clasess, neverthless, there is some people who agrees with that situation in education. Because, the online clasess are time limit so they can use their time wisely in other things and student who have to face transportation problem every morning, clasess from home will make their life more easier.

To bging taking online clasess from home is much more valuable because those clasess are time limited, so that student can use their other time wisely. For example, usually online clasess have seseaons which is fixed time. One course must have to be done by that seseaon time. In that case student can plan their study in a day and do a job in their free time. In USA most of the student have to take loan to finish thier education. So doing a job while taking an online course will help a lot with those loan terms. Clearly, it is binificial to take online clasess and agree with the offer of distance learning.

Farthermore, student who do not have own transportation, online clasess are the best option for them. For instance, in USA it is a big problem for people who do not have own transportation. Most of the time its the student who suffers most. Every single morning they have to rush for public transportation to go to the campus so that they will not get late for class. Some time it effects thier attendence, depends on institute and thier professors. This proves that taking an online class solve most of those problems easily. And student will be able to focuse on study more than handeling little problems like those, which is alomost turning into a part of their daily life.

Overall, it is much more imprtent that taking a class online saves time and let student do other jobs to earn enough and a oportunity for them to be on time when there is a possiblity of being late to the class only because of transportation problem. This shows that student should attend clasess from home by way of online or vedio conferencing and accept the offer of distance learning.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"There are many efforts from different countries to reduce car usage.  Countries like Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States are trying to raise awareness and get people to not use their car as much.  These countries are raising awareness for example by having car-free days, banning driving for a day, turning suburbs into car-free communities, and rasing awareness about how cars affect the enviroment.  These counrties are making the efforts to reduce car usage because they know that there are great advantages if citizens limit their car usage.

In Vauban,Germany, low-car suburban life is their motto.  Car ownership is allowed , but with a price.  As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move to Vauban.  Heidrun Walter says that she is happier without a car and when she did have a car, she says she was always tense.  Vauban is an example of the efforts and new idea that Europe, United States, and elsewhere have to reduce car usuage.  Some advantages of this low-car concept is that now stores are being placed in walking distance and malls and resturants are also within walking distance and close to each other.

Because of air pollution and smog due to cars, Paris had to start banning people from driving certain days.  If you  were caught driving when you weren't suppose to, a fine was inforced.  Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters.  Diesel fuel was the blame of the smog because France perfers diesel over gas.  Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France according to Reuters.  Paris has more smog than most European capitals.  This is really hurting the enviroment.  While Paris was banning cars, congestion was down 60 percent.  Besides car congestion being down 60 percent, other advatages to this car banning was that non-hybrid car companies lost revenue while hybrid and plug in cars were not.  This shows how people are aware of the pollution of cars.  Also, because of the reduced driving, the smog in Paris was cleared enough to stop banning certain vehicles from driving.

A big event in Bogota, Colombia is their car-free day.  Only buses and taxis were permitted.  Violators of the car-free day faced a fine.  The turnout was large even though there was rain.  ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"", said the Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus.  Citizens of Colombia were happy participating in the car-free day.

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike.  Municipal authorities from all over the world came to see this event. The city's mayor also says that the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid- 1990's.  The advantage of the car-free day has made parks and sports centers more popular to go to and other advatages is that the old sidewalks are being replaced with new paved ones.  The traffic has also reduced.

In the United States, President Obama goals are to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions.  The Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities.  The efforts to reduce driving is paying off.  A study found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.  Mr. Sivak's research shows a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year olds getting a liscense.  In New York, there is a new bike sharing program and that can help people to choose to take bike instead of riding in a car.

All these efforts are helping people make the decision to limit their car usage and based on the facts, there are alot of advantages if you limit car usage.  This is only a start to raise efforts to reduce car usage, but I feel in the future we will be seeing a lot more people walking and biking than riding their car.             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They belive that they have a better chance at making the right choice. There are many reasons why people seek multiple opinions, one might be trustworthiness , another would be the more wiser person, and the last reason is that people might get you out of trouble.
